Requirements: You will write three separate Java programs
1. Create a folder on your computer named program2. All three of your source code files should be created in this folder.
2. (5 points) In a Java class named Art, solve problem P1.8 from the end of chapter 1 in your textbook.
3. (5 points) In a Java class named House, solve problem P1.9 from the end of chapter 1 in your textbook. Make your house to exactly match the house that is shown.
4. (5 points) In a Java class named Translate, solve problem P1.20 from the end of chapter 1 in your textbook. Format your output using the format shown below, with phrases in each language arranged in a column. You may choose a language other than French. French is just an example. You should translate all 4 phrases.

English French
———————————————
Good morning Bonjour
It is a pleasure to meet you
Please call me tomorrow
Have a nice day

5. (5 points) Verify that your source code meets appropriate style guidelines, including comments (include name, date, section of CSE 174, and description) as well as any other guidelines described in the style guidelines document referenced earlier in this assignment.
6. (5 points) Follow these steps to submit your work:
a. Make sure the program2 folder contains the source code files (.java) for all three of your programs. It is OK if the folder also contains other files.
b. Compress the folder to create a zip file. Name the zip file program2.zip (Canvas might rename the file when you upload it…that’s OK.)
c. Submit only the zip file to the Canvas website.

Note: If you submit your work and decide to modify one of your programs, you need to resubmit a new zip file containing all three source code files (even if you only modified one of them). Do not rename your source code files. Do not rename the zip file. Canvas may add a number to the name of your zip file. That is fine. But you should keep all source code filenames the same as described above.
